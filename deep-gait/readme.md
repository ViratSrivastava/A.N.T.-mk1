# DeepGait

## Overview

Modern robotic systems often require advanced locomotion control strategies to navigate complex environments effectively. This project focuses on the development of a deep learning-based gait controller for a six-legged robot. The goal is to enable the robot to autonomously learn and optimize its walking pattern through the application of reinforcement learning techniques.

### Key Objectives

1. **Autonomous Gait Learning:** The primary objective is to train a deep neural network that can autonomously learn and adapt the gait pattern of a six-legged robot. The network should be capable of adjusting joint angles or motor actions to achieve stable and efficient locomotion.

2. **Adaptability:** The gait controller should exhibit adaptability to varying terrains and environmental conditions. The learned gait should generalize well and perform effectively in different scenarios.

3. **Simulation and Real-world Implementation:** The project aims to facilitate both simulation-based training and real-world implementation. The trained model should seamlessly transfer its learned behaviors to physical robots, demonstrating robustness and reliability.

### Components

- **Gait Controller Neural Network:** The core component is a deep neural network responsible for mapping the robot's state to motor actions. The network architecture is designed to be flexible, allowing it to learn and represent complex gait patterns.

- **Robot Environment Simulation:** The SixLeggedRobotEnvironment class simulates the dynamics of the six-legged robot. It provides an interface for the neural network to interact with the environment, receiving feedback and adjusting its parameters.

- **Training Script:** The `train_gait_controller.py` script orchestrates the training process. It involves the iterative interaction between the neural network and the simulated environment, optimizing the controller's parameters over epochs.

### Results and Evaluation

The project's success will be measured by the effectiveness of the trained gait controller in achieving stable and adaptive locomotion. Evaluation metrics include the robot's walking speed, energy efficiency, and its ability to handle diverse terrains.

### Future Work

Future developments may involve incorporating more advanced reinforcement learning techniques, integrating sensor feedback for improved environmental awareness, and extending the gait controller to handle dynamic obstacles.

This project aims to contribute to the field of robotics by providing a framework for developing adaptive and intelligent locomotion strategies for legged robots.

## Scripts

### [train_gait_controller.py](scripts/train_gait_controller.py)

The `train_gait_controller.py` script is the main entry point for training the deep gait controller neural network. It orchestrates the training process, interacting with the simulated robot environment and optimizing the neural network's parameters over multiple epochs. This script is crucial for developing an adaptive and effective gait for the six-legged robot.

### [robot_environment.py](scripts/robot_environment.py)

The `robot_environment.py` script defines the simulation environment for the six-legged robot. It includes the `SixLeggedRobotEnvironment` class, responsible for simulating the dynamics of the robot, updating its state based on motor actions, and providing feedback to the neural network during training. This script is essential for creating a realistic training environment.
